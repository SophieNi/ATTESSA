### Setup

- [ ] Install Postgres server on Raspberrypi
- [ ] Setup remote ssh tunnel (via Serveo)
- [ ] Setup permissions

### Data Collection

- [ ] Find API for news
- [ ] Implement web scrapers
- [ ] Scheduling

### BERT
- [ ] Find Pre-trained models of BERT on Sentimental Analysis
- [ ] Data labeling (via Prodigy) [Percentage: 0.0%]
- [ ] Fine tune the model [Accuracy: 0.0%]

### Time Series Prediction
- [ ] Idea 1: use simple forecasting models(SARIMA)
- [ ] Idea 2: signal processing using FFT + Deep Learning

### Price Prediction
